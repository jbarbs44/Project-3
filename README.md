# Project 3: Visualizing Data
Visualizing data is a form of story telling in which we convey a story through images and create narratives with data. When a company has massive amounts of data gathered, it can be difficult and slow to sort, comprehend, and explain that day. Visualization offers a way to speed this process up and inform owners, stakeholders, clients, etc. about Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) which can quantify or gauge a company's overall performance and success.

## **Introduction**<br/>
In this project, we're practicing visualizing data with a full-stack application which allows a user to explore data related to all Nobel Prize Winners from 1901 - 2022. <br/>

## **Data**
For our project, we have visualized data extracted from the following dataset available in the Resources folder <br/>
   * nobel_latest.csv <br/>

## **How to Run**
* No additional packages have to be installed if `flask` , `numpy`, `gunicorn`, `sqlalchemy`, `folium`, and `pandas` are already in your program. <br/>

## **Outcome**
We were succesfully able to: <br/>
* visualize and create interactive data<br/>   
   * website: group5project3(tbd)

## **Technology/Tools used**
* Backend <br/>
    *Flask <br/>
    *SQLite <br/>
    *Numpy <br/>
    *Folium <br/>

* Frontend <br/>
    *JS <br/>
    *D3 <br/>
    *Plotly <br/>
